# Lucy

This is the name given to the language for which the compiler/interpreter is developed as a part of an assignment of compiler construction course.

-   This is basically the frontend part of compiler we say, where language syntax and grammar rules are implemented using lexer. The backend part such as the target code generation is still remained to do. Hence as of this repository the creation of AST and then execution of the program is done by union, structures and functions well-written in C Language.

-   The Code folder contains all the necessary code files and Tools folder contains required tools to compile the code files and execute the programs written in `Lucy`. Basically you need to run 4 commands in sequence for the same, but that's aggregated inside `\Tools\win_flex_bison\compile.bat` and that's all you need.

-   You will find more details inside `/Docs/Report.pdf` about the features or specifications and work carried out in the language, sample program's execution and limitations. The code is having meaningful variable and function names and also comments wherever required to understand the logic. The codes may have extra or altered better features as compare to the description given in the report. The language resambles to the C and JavaScript.
